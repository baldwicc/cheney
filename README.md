# Cheney - A default user interface for Quail

[Quail](http://quailjs.org) is a jQuery plugin that can test pages against a suite of accessibility tests; however, it comes with no user interface, and it's up to developers to build their own methods for translating test messages and building a good UI. Cheney is a default user interface with higher-level APIs for providing test strings (converting "imgHasAlt" to "hey, this image needs an alt attribute").


### Why the name "cheney?""

Just Google "cheney quail."
